Pack Contents/Description:
--------------------------

This pack contains the Exnem Items MiniMOD. All spells, items, and creatures from
spells are included, and some more besides (higher stacking, lower ID
requirements). It now comes in WeiDU format.

Exnem Items:
   - 21 New Spells
   - 88 New Items

==================================================================================
MOD COMPATIBILITY:
------------------

This mod is now somewhat universally compatible. It is a WeiDU installed mod and 
as such should be installed AFTER any mod that replaces the dialog.tlk file or 
uses the TBG/IAP/SFX format.

Tested on BP and BGT-BP games.  It should work on any TOB game now.  With the new
version of Weidu, the second part allows items to be added to creatures already in
the game without having to copy over them.  If other mods do the same (such as
Freedom Reign), you may have an overload of items on the creature.  Doesn't effect
anything other than the amount of treasure.

Version 5 now works on CtB games.  The random Exnem treasure has now been included 
into the regular RNDTRE04 and RNDTRE05 treasures.  So now it is possible to find
an orc with two Exnem potions or two silver rings.  The same applies to the area
item additions.  Where you expected an Exnem item before may now be any random
treasure of that level.

==================================================================================
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------

You do not need to start a new game.  All items and spells will need to be CLUA'd
into your current game, unless you add the items to creatures and locations.  If you
install the third part, locations, you will need to restart your game to see the
changes.

==================================================================================
HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------

Extract it from the zip file, into the folder where you installed Baldur's Gate II
(commonly c:\program files\black isle\baldurs gate II\). Then double-click on the
Setup-Exnem.exe file. It will give you the option to install Exnem Items. To 
uninstall, repeat the procedure and follow the on-screen instructions. Enjoy!

Note: Exnem is a ToB mod and should only be installed if you have ToB installed.
