Duration: 8 min
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 30 feet 
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell affects any creatures in the area it is cast upon. The term creature means any living and undead form, including humans, orcs, animals, zombies, vampires, monsters, etc.

The creatures receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect (with a -23 modifier), with any adjustment due to Wisdom.
If the spell recipients fail their saving throw, they regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected.  The caster may give them orders, and the charmed individuals will carry them out as quickly as possible.
If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creatures by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creatures, the charm spell is broken. 
If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.  Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. 
Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he was charmed.~

  SAY NAME2 ~The Sword of Zeus~ 
  SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords.  In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

  SAY DESC ~The history behind this blade is quite bizarre.

It was found by kid in some sewers near his house. He took it home with him, and within a day or two, all his family, him included,  had become sick and diseased. One day later they were all found dead. The blade was also found and taken to be studied by scholars from the area. Soon enough, they also fell sick and died. This tale went on for some decades. The sword spreading its poison wherever it was taken.
One day, finally, a wise alchemist was able to concentrate that virus, and gave the sword a way to release this poison, aimed at one target, at the wielder's will.
